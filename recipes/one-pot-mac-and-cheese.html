    <h2>Classic, but amazing</h2>
    <p>This one-pot mac and cheese is a family favorite, and my 3-year-old is always thrilled to see it coming to the dinner table. We love to add sliced smoked sausage to this creamy mac recipe!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3-1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 package (16 ounces) elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 ounces Velveeta, cubed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, combine milk, water and macaroni; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until macaroni is tender and almost all the cooking liquid has been absorbed, 12-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low; stir in cheeses until melted. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
